# Intro
This is a fork of the Xusca_guestbook website. It is meant to become a more complete message board, with features such as consistent session cookies for username rather than randomly generated ones and an option to create an account. The "name" field is phased out. 

# Current Features Added: 
1. mysql instead of flat file. 
2. phased out name field in favor of unique session cookies. 

# To Implement
1. login system so not everyone is anonymous. 
2. probably better security bc IDK half of what I'm doing.
